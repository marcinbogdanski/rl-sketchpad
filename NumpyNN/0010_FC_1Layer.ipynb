    "Presented neural network contains only one layer (output). While code in the notebook can support any number of neurons, both examples have single neuron. In this notebook I demonstrate simplest possible neural network, hence I will use mean squared error loss function and full gradient descent (train on whole dataset all at once).\n",

While it's possible to analyse small neural nets directly, computational graphs provide scalable mental framework to analyse and implement very deep and complex neural nets. They allows us to define forward operations and derive backpropagation formulas **one operation at a time**. Resulting implementation will be similarly modular. This will be indispensable when working with deeper, more complex architectures (convnets, recurrent, etc.).
